This is an ongoing research project by [Eric Rawn](https://www.ericrawn.media/) as a version control system for Processing. It's currently unreleased, but expect it soon! 

If you've been invited to evaluate it and are looking for info, please take a look at the [documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/erawn/Quickpose/wiki/What-happens-when-you-run-Quickpose-on-a-Processing-Project).

Quickpose is currently in two parts: a canvas-editor front-end which is a fork of Tldraw, by steve ruiz, and a backend written as a Tool for Processing 3.5.4

If you're interested in this project and want to learn more, shoot me an email at erawn@berkeley.edu. Otherwise, stay tuned for an official release (hopefully this fall!) 

This project relies on the amazing work in Tldraw - please consider becoming a sponsor of Steve's(https://github.com/sponsors/steveruizok?frequency=recurring&sponsor=steveruizok).
