### Quickpose is a version control system for [Processing](https://processing.org) designed for creative exploration. With 1-click forking and navigating, canvas annotations and notes, and automatic saves and backups, Quickpose isn't just version control system,  *it helps you manage your entire creative process*. 


This is an ongoing research project by [Eric Rawn](https://www.ericrawn.media/) as a version control system for Processing. It's currently unreleased, but expect it soon!

# What is Quickpose?

## Quickpose is a version control system inside of a canvas editor â€” it directly links your canvas to your code state:
<div style="text-align: center; transform: scale(.5);">
  <img src="./assets/linkedstate.gif"/>
</div>

## You can fork a version with just a single (shift) click:

<div style="text-align: center; transform: scale(.5);">
  <img src="./assets/fork.gif"/>
</div>

## To change versions, just click the version on your canvas and the editor will update:
<div style="text-align: center; transform: scale(.5);">
  <img src="./assets/navigate.gif"/>
</div>

## The canvas editor works as you'd expect, with shapes, scribbles, arrows, stickies, and Images:

<div style="text-align: center; transform: scale(.5);">
  <img src="./assets/stickies.gif"/>
</div>

## Putting version control in a canvas allows us to do things like _export by color_:
Export By Color Menu       |  Your Export in Your Sketch Folder

REPL mode is highly recommended for a smooth experience.

If you've been invited to evaluate it and are looking for info, please take a look at the [documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/erawn/Quickpose/wiki/What-happens-when-you-run-Quickpose-on-a-Processing-Project).

Quickpose is currently in two parts: a canvas-editor front-end which is a fork of Tldraw, by steve ruiz, and a backend written as a Tool for Processing 3.5.4

This project relies on the amazing work in Tldraw - please consider becoming a sponsor of Steve's(https://github.com/sponsors/steveruizok?frequency=recurring&sponsor=steveruizok).
